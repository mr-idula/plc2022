Lexical Analyzer and Syntaz Analyzer. 
In the lexical analyzer class, I assigned each token (which included mathematical operations, variable assignments, characters, strings, natural literals, real literals) to a symbol or character. Based off the production rules I made, the methods (methods were chosen based off the starting character or symbol) in the syntax analyzer confirm if the statement is valid or not.
